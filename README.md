### ONBOARDING

On installing the app, the user is taken to the onboarding screen as a first time user where the user gets to see details about the app. The user also has the choice to skip the entire onboarding process or move through the whole process. There are three slides showing details about the app and the user can move through them by swiping with the fingers or clicking on the next button. At the last slide, the button text changes from "Next" to "Get Started".

### ORDERING FOOD
To order food, the user can search by food name or restaurant name or use the food category filter at the top. On selecting any of the restaurants, the user is taken to the restaurant page and gets to see the foods sold by the restaurant and then make an order for any food of choice. Clicking on the add button besides each food adds the food the user's cart where the user gets to see the total price.

When the user is satisfied with the items in the cart, the user can click on the view cart button and is taken to another page where they see the items in their cart. In this page, the user gets to either confirm or change the address they want the food delivered to, the quantity of each food item as well as get a discount if they have a coupon code to apply.
